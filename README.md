# HMM_SPEECH
Implementation of Isolated Hidden Markov Models for Speech Recognition. These models use the Baum Welch Iterative algorithm for training. 

In order to obtain the weights, firstly unzip the Isolated_Digits folder and make the necessary changes to the repo addresses in the main.py.
Post this, run the main.py in finalcode folder. This will generate a weight matrix which will help you generate further roc curves and so on.
